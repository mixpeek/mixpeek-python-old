- [Bugs & Questions](https://github.com/mixpeek/mixpeek-python#bugs-&-questions)

## Quickstart

Upload any filetype from the supported filetype [list here](https://mixpeek.com/learn)

```python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mix = Mixpeek(api_key="API_KEY")

# index one local pdf document without any extra metadata
mix.index("/user/desktop/file.pdf")

# with extra metadata
mix.index("/user/desktop/file.pdf", user_id="123", tags="document, legal", static_file_url="cdn.host.com/file.pdf")
```

...or any audio filetype

```python
mix.index("/user/desktop/never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3")
```

... or an image, video, document or [anything else mixpeek supports](https://mixpeek.com/learn)

```python
video = mix.index("/user/desktop/video.avi")
image = mix.index("/user/desktop/image.png")
markdown = mix.index("/user/desktop/markdown.md")
```

The API will return the `file_id`, be sure to store this:

```python
# response
{
    "file_id": "63a32cca0de5e4ce354a4b1c"
}
```

Now you can search across all your files:

```python
mix.search(query="let you down")

# response
[
    {
        "file_id": "6377c98b3c4f239f17663d79",
        "filename": "prescription.pdf",
        "importance": "100%",
        "static_file_url": "s3://audio.mp3"
    }
]

```

And you can include other parameters in your search query:

```python
mix.search("readme", user_id="john_smith_123", context="true", tags="legal, document")

# response
[
    {
        "file_id": "63a32cd70de5e4ce354a4b1f",
        "filename": "system-design-primer.md",
        "static_file_url": "s3://audio.mp3",
        "user_id": "john_smith_123",
        "tags":["legal", "document"],
        "highlights": [
            {
                "texts": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "value": "- What is the expected "
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "hit",
                        "value": "read"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "value": " to write ratio?\n\n"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "importance": "100%"
    }
]
```

## Installation

Installing mixpeek is easy

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/mixpeek/mixpeek-python.git@master
```

## S3 Support

Be sure you create an AWS access key/secret key combo with S3 bucket read permissions using [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

Files are never stored on our servers, review our [security principles](https://mixpeek.com/security).

```python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mix = Mixpeek(
    api_key="mixpeek_api_key",
    access_key="aws_access_key",
    secret_key="aws_secret_key",
    region="region"
)

mix.index_bucket("mixpeek-public-demo")

# response (list of File_ids)

{
    "file_ids": [
        "63a33611660c021b50271666",
        "63a33611660c021b50271667",
