## Quickstart

Upload any image filetype for text extraction

```python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mix = Mixpeek(
    api_key="my-api-key"
)

mix.upload(file_name="website_screenshot.png", file_path="desktop/username/tmp/website_screenshot.png")
```

...or any audio filetype

```python
mix.upload(file_name="never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3", file_path="desktop/username/tmp/never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3")
```

... or a pdf, or doc, or [anything else tika supports](https://tika.apache.org/0.9/formats.html)

```python
pdf_version = mix.upload(file_name="some_document.pdf", file_path="desktop/username/tmp/some_document.pdf")
doc_version = mix.upload(file_name="some_document.doc", file_path="desktop/username/tmp/some_document.doc")
html_version = mix.upload(file_name="some_document.html", file_path="desktop/username/tmp/some_document.html")
```

The API will return some information including the extracted text:

```python
{
    "code": 200,
    "endpoint": "/upload",
    "ok": True,
    "response": {
        "_id": "615e71fd47d7df57aeb93c27",
        "api_key": "your_api_key",
        "corpus": "Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.",
        "metadata": {
            "date_inserted": "2021-10-07 04:05:17.942499",
            "filename": "never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3"
            "file_url": "desktop/username/tmp/never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3"
        }
    },
    "timestamp": 1633579517.955764
}
```

Search for file contents:

```python
query = mix.search(query="let you down")

print(query)

[
    {
        "_id": "615e71fd47d7df57aeb93c27",
        "api_key": "REDACTED",
        "highlights": [
            {
                "score": 0.8759502172470093,
                "texts": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "value": "Never gonna give you up. Never gonna "
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "hit",
                        "value": "let you down"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "value": ". Never gonna run around and desert you."
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "metadata": {
            "date_inserted": "2021-10-07 04:05:17.942499",
            "filename": "never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3"
            "file_url": "desktop/username/tmp/never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3"            
        },
        "score": 0.13313256204128265
    }
